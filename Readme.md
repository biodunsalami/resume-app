## MyResume App
MyResume is an android app that showcases an interactive version of my resume.\
The app reveals necessary information about me as it would be in a traditional resume but in a rather fun and engaging way.

### App Description
When the app is launched, the user is met with a Landing screen that welcomes user and shows a short bio of me. \
Navigating further into the app takes the user to an About screen which displays in sections, technical information about me. \
Then user can then either navigate to a Portfolio screen or a Contact screen. \
The Portfolio screen shows a list of some noteworthy projects I have worked on while the Contact screen shows a bit more informationabout me and links to reach me.

### App Structure
The current structure is the codebase is quite simplistic in approach, yet open ended for the addition of more feature. \
**Models** - models consist of data classes that holds required fields \
**Adapter** - contains a base Recycler Adapter to bind various datasets to the different Recycler Views \
**Data** - consists of a Data object that is used as the data source \
**Presentation** - the app uses a single activity with multiple fragments approach; all of which are contained in the Presentation package




**Design**
The design exhibits a minimalist approach that facilitates readability. The use of bottom navigation menu was employed to enable easy navigation between fragments.

The design was inspired by one I found on Behance, created by Yassein Salahuldin \

### Libraries
1. Android Jetpack Navigation Components was used to facilitate navigation
2. CircularImageView by Mikhael Lopez was used to displays a profile-photo-like Image View

### Possible feature
If I had more time, I would love to add the ability to add and edit data dynamically to the app

### Challenges
The major challenge was implementing the design. Thanks to Yassein's design I was able to draw inspiration from that and make mine.
